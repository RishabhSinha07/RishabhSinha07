### Hi, I’m Rishabh 👋

## AI Engineer • LLM Developer • Software Engineer

I build **AI-powered applications** using **Large Language Models**, focusing on practical, production-ready systems. My interests include **LLM orchestration, autonomous agents, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and developer tooling**.

* 🔭 Building AI applications using **LangChain, LLMs, and agent-based workflows**
* 🧠 Working with **OpenAI APIs, prompt engineering, and model evaluation**
* 🧩 Designing **RAG pipelines** with vector databases and structured data
* ⚙️ Experience integrating AI into **web apps, automation, and internal tools**
* 🏗️ Software Engineer at **Amazon**
* 👯 Open to collaborating on **AI tools, open-source projects, and research-driven prototypes**
* ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy exploring how LLMs fail just as much as how they succeed 😄
